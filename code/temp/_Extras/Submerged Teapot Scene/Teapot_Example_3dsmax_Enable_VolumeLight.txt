The Teapot_Example scenes for 3ds max include a built-in setup for rendering volumetric light (god rays), that can be composited on top of the beauty render in After Effects, Fusion etc.

Note: The V-Ray 5 example scenes for 3ds max utilize the material library that is included with V-Ray 5. If you do not have the material library installed, the objects in the scene will be missing their textures.

This is how you enable the volumetric light pass:

1. Open one of the Teapot*.max example scenes in 3ds max
2. Make sure to relink all bitmaps so that the V-Ray shaders and Caustic maps are properly loaded (the VRayBitmap for both caustic maps should be set to "Inverse Gamma" or "None" in the Color Space Transfer Function)
3. Open Scene Explorer/Layer Manager and hide the "02_Lights_for_Beauty" layer and unhide the "03_Lights_for_VolumeLight" layer
4. Open the Render Setup window and inside the V-Ray tab, go to Global Switches and enable the Material Override (there should already be a BLACK material inside it)
5. Next go to the GI tab and disable Global Illumination
6. Hit render - and the result should be an image with only volumetric light/god rays shining down on the seabed, ready for compositing on top of your beauty pass with Add/Screen blending mode

Happy rendering!
